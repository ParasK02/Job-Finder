## Job Finder
Since im looking for COOP opportunities I thought an app that shows you nearby and popular jobs would be really fun! In this app it fetches data from an external API using RapidAPI, have a search bar to change the search query that is used by the API hook and the ability to apply from the app. This app was made using React Native and Axios. 
## Installation / Usage 

Make sure to have [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Use expo to use launch and use the app.  

```bash
npm start
```
My API calls from the API are close to running out :( you can replace it with your own if you'd like to test for maximum useability.
