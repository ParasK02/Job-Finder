## Job Finder
Since I'm looking for COOP opportunities I thought an app that shows you nearby and popular jobs would be really fun! This app fetches data from an external API using RapidAPI and has a search bar to change the search query that is used by the API hook and the ability to apply from the app. Using hook calls from the API this app allows uses pagination to separate the data into three sections: About, Qualifications and Responsibilities. This app was made using React Native and Axios. 
## Installation / Usage 

Make sure to have [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Use expo to use launch and use the app.  

```bash
npm start
```
My API calls from the API are close to running out :( you can replace it with your own if you'd like to test for maximum useability.
